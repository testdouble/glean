# glean

Just the start of a little report that plays off Harvest's API via the [harvested](https://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested) gem.

Requires a config/credentials.yml file (see [example](https://github.com/testdouble/glean/blob/main/config/credentials.yml.example)), then:

``` bash
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
